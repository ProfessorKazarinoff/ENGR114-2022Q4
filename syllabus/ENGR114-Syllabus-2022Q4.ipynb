    "## Course Components\n",
    "\n",
    "### Homework\n",
    "\n",
    "Homework is intended as a means of practicing the concepts presented in class. It is advised that you keep up with your homework assignments each week and submit each week’s assignment to D2L. Homework will be reviewed by your instructor to determine which topics need more reinforcement and as a way for you and your instructor to share your course progress. Homework will not be included in your grades and homework due dates will not be enforced by grading.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Labs\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, lecture is held early in the week and lab held later in the week. Lab assignments are typically due at the end of the lab period, uploaded to D2L. Your median lab score (your middle lab score, not your average lab score) will be used to calculate your final grade. Lab assignments can be re-done and re-submitted to improve your grade. All lab re-submissions must be uploaded to D2L by Monday at 12noon, the last week of the quarter (the Monday before finals week). No labs submitted after this date will be evaluated for course credit. This enforced due date ensures your instructor has time to grade your lab assignments before the end of the quarter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exams\n",
    "\n",
    "If a student is unable to take the exam when it is scheduled, it is the student’s responsibility to notify the instructor at least 1 week prior to the date of an exam. Make-up exams, if allowed, will be scheduled by the instructor after consulting with the student prior to the original date of the exam. I look forward to working with any students who have testing accommodations. It is the student’s responsibility to set up a meeting at least 1 week prior to the exam date to review exam protocol. There will be two Exams in the course: one Midterm Exam and one Final Exam.\n",
    " \n",
    "#### Exam Deadlines and Grading:\n",
    " \n",
    " * Exams can be completed at any time during the week the exam is posted. Once you open the exam in D2L, you have 3 hours to complete the exam and upload your exam to D2L.\n",
    " * Exam uploads after the deadline posted in D2L will receive a 0 (Insufficient evidence).\n",
    " * You can re-do your Exam 1. Exam 1 re-dos are due by the last week of the quarter, Monday at 12noon. No Exam 1 re-do’s will be accepted after this due date for a grade in order to give your instructor sufficient time to grade your Exam ! re-dos by the end of the quarter.\n",
    " * Exams which contain coppied work of others will recieve a 0 (Insufficient evidence). The instructor can not assess student learning when a student submits someone else’s work. A student who re- cieves a 0 (Insufficient evidence) on Exam 1 must complete an Exam 1 re-do by the last week of the quarter, Monday at 12noon.\n",
    " * There will be no Exam 2 re-do’s.\n",
    "\n",
    "### In-Class Assignments\n",
    "Most lecture days include an in-class practice that should to be uploaded to D2L by the end of the class period. See D2L for specific in-class practice details. In-class practice will not be graded. Use in-class practice to track your progress in the course and guage your participation in the course. In-class assign- ments will not be included in your grades and in-class assignment due dates will not be enforced by grading."
